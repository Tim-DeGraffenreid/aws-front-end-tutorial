        Zoie had a secret. Well, not a <span class="font-semibold">secret</span> exactly, because everyone in her family could hear—and smell—it. Zoie farted all the time.

        Her little sister, <span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">Alaia</span>, hated it. "Zoie! You’re gross!"
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        "It wasn’t me," Zoie said, smirking. "It was the chair."
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Grandma Vance just laughed. <span class="italic text-purple-600">"Let her be, Alaia. A good fart builds character."</span>
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Zoie loved Grandma Vance. She didn’t judge her farting skills. In fact, Zoie suspected Grandma knew something.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        One evening, after a dinner full of beans, Zoie felt it. A <span class="text-red-600 font-extrabold">BIG</span> one coming on. She rushed to her room to let it out, but Alaia followed her.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        <span class="text-pink-600 font-bold">"You’re gonna blow the house up, aren’t you?"</span> Alaia said, plugging her nose.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        <span class="text-blue-600 font-bold">"Shhh!"</span> Zoie said. "It feels... magical."
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Zoie squeezed her eyes shut and let it rip.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4 text-center">

          <img src='/zoey-1.webp'/>
        </div>
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        The loudest fart Zoie had ever heard exploded into the room—and with it came a glittery rainbow that sparkled in the air.
      </p>
      </div>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        "WHAT DID YOU DO?!" Alaia shrieked.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        "Look!" Zoie said, pointing at the rainbow. It swirled and twisted until a tiny skunk-like fairy appeared, wings buzzing.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        <span class="text-purple-600 font-bold">"Greetings, Fart Hero!"</span> the fairy said. "Your magical toots power our kingdom!"
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Grandma Vance poked her head in, cackling. "I knew it! The magic fart gene runs in the family!"
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        Zoie beamed. "You mean I’m a hero?"
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        "Sure," Grandma said. "But let’s keep it to yourself. No one likes a show-off!"
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
        From that day on, Zoie’s farts weren’t just funny—they were legendary. Even Alaia had to admit: her sister’s magical toots were pretty cool.
